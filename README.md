# Resume Filtering Solution with Power BI

This Power BI project is a dynamic and interactive *Resume Filtering Dashboard* designed to help hiring managers and recruiters explore and screen potential candidates efficiently.

## Project Motivation

The idea was sparked after I watched @Onyinyechukwu Ojike presentation on the @Winnipeg power platform user group youtube. It inspired me to replicate and improve the concept using my own dataset and visualization approach.

## Features

- *Dynamic Filters*: Search candidates by job role, expertise level, job type, location, and years of experience.
- *Candidate Table*: View a list of applicants with direct links to their LinkedIn profiles.
- *Sleek Interface*: Professionally styled landing page and user-friendly layout.
- *Scalable Dataset*: Easily expandable to accommodate hundreds or thousands of candidate profiles.

## Tools Used

- *Power BI Desktop*
- *Power Query*
- *DAX*
- *Custom Visuals & Slicers*
